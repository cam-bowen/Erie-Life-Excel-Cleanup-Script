# Erie-Life-Excel-Cleanup-Script
This is a simple python script to clean up an erie life report that our company Assure America recieves from Erie Insurance. We have to the spreadsheet they send us into a program called Applied Systems. The spreadsheet they send us does not easily import into Applied, so I created a python script to automate the cleanup.
