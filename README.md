# Erie-Life-Excel-Cleanup-Script
This is a simple python script to clean up an Erie Life report that our company Assure America recieves from Erie Insurance. We have to import the spreadsheet they send us into a program called Applied Systems. The spreadsheet they send us does not easily import into Applied, so I created a python script to automate the cleanup. 

This process use to take us 30 minutes, now it is done within seconds. 

There will be more updates as time goes on.
